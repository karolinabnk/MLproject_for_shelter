# MLproject_for_shelter

An experimental project which aim was to explore the data from an animal shelter and try out some machine learning algorithms to eventually try to predict outcomes for animals in the shelter. 
The overwhelming majority of the project is based on sklearn library. For an evaluation, the accuracy_score and f1_score was used, possibly with the micro average.

This was the final project for the Basics of the Machine Learnig course.
